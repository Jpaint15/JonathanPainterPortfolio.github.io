                        <h1>IMBD Project-Tableau</h1>
                        <p>
                            In this project we're continuing the project we started first in SQL where we used 2 different datasets for our query to develop
                            tables and undercover some of the key points in our data. There are 4 different datasets we are using in this one, this is also a
                            selected portion of the real data from around the world because we're using the same data we inserted into SQL in the previous part of
                            the project.

                            <h2>Dataset</h2>
                            <p>
                                <img src="images/ImbdDataset.png" alt="" width="1400" height="600" /> 
                                <br>
                                In this small screen grab from out data source we see theres columns for the series title, Genre, Runtime, IMBD rating, etc.
                                There's a bunch of different columns that we can use in Tableau to sort through and find trends that we can then visualize 
                                into a dashboard.
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Visualizations</h2>
                            <p>
                                <img src="images/vizimbd1.png" alt="" width="1400" height="900"/> 
                                <br>
                                In our first visualization we're measuring genre by the gross amount of money made in that particular genre. As we see the genre that 
                                made to most amount of money by far is 'Action' with about 21 million made and the next highest made being 'Adventure'. This is a descending bar 
                                graph that shows the range of money made in each genre of film and let's us know how the money is being distributed.

                                <br>
                                <img src="images/imbdviz2.png" alt="" weight="800" height="900"/> 
                                <br>
                                In our second visualization we just want to display the highest rated IMBD movies so we can have some variety to our dashboard and this 
                                is the only way we can incorporate all the films in the dataset that people can scroll through to see. We excluded one piece of data that 
                                exceeded the 1 to 10 scale IMBD uses to rate all their movies. The highest rated movie is 'The Shawshank Redemption' at 9.3 followed by a lot
                                of others close behind.

                                <br>
                                <img src="images/imbdviz3.png" alt="" weight="800" height="900"/> 
                                <br>
                                In our third visualization we want to see if theres any correlation between the year the film was released and the average amount of money made that
                                year across all film genres. We see the biggest spikes came in at 1977 and 2018. There's a big drop near the end that had to deal with covid and movies 
                                not being watched at theatres across the world. 

                                <br>
                                <img src="images/imbdviz4.png" alt="" weight="800" height="900"/> 
                                <br>
                                In our fourth and final visualization we're creating a pie graph of the metascores across all genres. This pie graph is a little misleading because it shows 
                                film-noir as the highest average meta score genre but there were only a couple instances of that particular genre. Exlcuding that genre Animation and Thriller 
                                were the 2 highest average meta-scored genres of the dataset.

                                <br>
                            </p>

                            <br>
