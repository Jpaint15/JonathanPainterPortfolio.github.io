                        <h1>Tabelau Project</h1>
                        <p>
                            In this project I worked on using data downloaded from Kaggle to explore it and explain it further visually
                            and verbally through a dashboard made up of data visualizations.

                            <h2>Dataset</h2>
                            <p>
                                <img src="images/Dataset.png" alt="" weight="200" height="300" /> 
                                <br>
                                In the dataset there is a lot of different information that cant be visualized so it was important to go through
                                the different joins and see the data that can be visualized. We find out the prices can be compared to when and where
                                the AirBnbs were purchased. We can do this based on Zipcode, State, Country, etc.
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Visualizations</h2>
                            <p>
                                <img src="images/dashboard.png" alt="" weight="800" height="900"/> 
                                <br>
                                Here's a screenshot of the dashboard I created that combined the different sheets I had used to create the data visualizations 
                                and a table that counted the number of AirBnb listings for each number of available bedrooms. On the bar chart at the top it measures
                                the average price of the Airbnb verse the Number of Beds in the Listing. There's then a map that's color coded based on the zipcodes 
                                that shows the average price per listing based on the zipcode. This corresponds to the barchart to it's right that shows the barchart
                                for different zipcodes based on the average price per listing with it also being color coded to the legend to its right. And finally 
                                in the bottom right theres a line chart that shows the AirBnb Revenue for the year and when its best to put up a listing

                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>CONNNNNNNSSSS</h2>
                            <p>
                                From these visualizations we can concurr that from the Barchart in the bottom middle, the zipcode 98119 has the highest average price
                                per listing which we can presume that the listed places are more bigger, more expensive, and in better neighborhoods. In the line chart
                                we see that it might be more profitable to list on AirBnb in the Winter as theirs a spike in the beginning of the year and an
                                uptick from November to December, so those 3 straight months AirBnb is making the most money which means more people are buying at that time.
                                In the table in the top right shows the number of distinct listings per the amount of bedrooms so we can see there's 4 times the number of
                                1 bedroom AirBnb's than the next closest being 2 bedrooms. We can conclude this is mostly for people traveling alone or with a significant other.

                            </p>
